              A household fuel cell works by using hydrogen to cleanly and
              efficiently generate electricity. These fuel cells only
              use hydrogen as fuel towards electricity, water, and heat. Their versatility is not
              to be understated and can be used for a variety of powered applications. Another positive is that they dispense next to 
              or entirely no environmental emissions unlike their combustion engine counterparts.

                The installation of a household hydrogen fuel cell is usually
                around $30,000 to $100,000 and the hydrogen gas is around
                $13-$16 per kilogram.
