              A geothermal heat pump is used to transfer heat into and out of a
              household by using the ground to gather heat as well as dispense heat.
              This means that heat is traveling through the ground from a high
              temperature place to a low one or vice versa. Some models of these
              geothermal heat pump systems have additions built for even more
              comfort and energy savings for the owner. A positive to buying a
              geothermal system over an air-source system is that they are
              quieter, need little maintenance, and they donâ€™t depend on the
              weather or temperature outside.

            <div class="col title fs-5  leftrightpadding ">
              With a ducted air-source heat pump or heating system, a household
              is able to reduce the amount of electricity used for heating by
              65% compared to the average heating of a house furnace or boiler.
              These models of heat pumps are highly efficient and can dehumidify
              a household's air better than standard central air conditioners.
              This means that the amount of energy being used by a ducted heat
              pump uses less energy and allows for more cooling in the hotter
              months of the year.

            <div class="col title fs-5  leftrightpadding ">
              If the household trying to install an air-source heat pump does
              not have the necessary ducts to install the unit, ductless heat pumps provide
              an effective alternative. These air-source pumps are
              sometimes called mini-split heat pumps and they are able to circulate hot
              and cold water in its system instead of using the air around it.
              Functionally, these pumps behave very similarly to their air-sourced cousins.
