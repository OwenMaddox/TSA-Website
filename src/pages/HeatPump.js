              description="Heat pumps transfer heat into and out of the home using the ground as both a heat source and a heat sink. Certain models of geothermal systems are available with two-speed compressors and variable fans for more comfort and energy savings. Relative to air-source heat pumps, they are quieter, last longer, need little maintenance, and do not depend on the temperature of the outside air."
